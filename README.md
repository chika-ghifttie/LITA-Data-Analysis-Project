## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of sales performance for a retail store using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to uncover key insights, such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.

## Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this project is the Capstone Project file. it includes details like OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Region, OrderDate, Quantity, UnitPrice.


## Key Features

- Data Exploration: Initial analysis performed in Excel using pivot tables and formulas to summarize sales data and calculate metrics.
- SQL Queries: Data loaded into SQL Server for advanced querying, extracting insights such as total sales by product category and monthly sales totals.
- Interactive Dashboard: A comprehensive Power BI dashboard visualizing sales performance, including sales overview, top-performing products, regional breakdowns, and user-interactive slicers for data filtering.

## Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this project is the Capstone Project file. it includes details like OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Region, OrderDate, Quantity, UnitPrice.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection,
2. Data cleaning and formatting,
3. Data Transformation: Converted data types as needed (e.g., dates, currencies) to facilitate analysis,
4. Filtering: Removed any irrelevant or duplicate entries from the dataset to streamline analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this phase, I conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and answer key questions regarding sales performance. The following techniques were utilized:
- Pivot Tables: Used pivot tables in Excel to explore and summarize total sales by product, region, and month, facilitating the identification of trends and outliers.
- Visualizations: Created visual representations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to visually interpret data and highlight significant findings.

#### Key Questions Addressed:
  -  What are the top-selling products?
  -  How do sales vary by region?
  -  What are the monthly sales trends?
  -  Which days of the week see the highest sales?
